# ARGO 1.3

The ‘Argo’ program draws its name from ancient Greek, referencing the vessel of the same name commissioned for Jason’s renowned Argonauts expedition. This choice symbolizes the pursuit of making the best use of quantum chemical calculation results.

ARGO facilitates the analysis of results obtained from quantum chemistry codes, specifically Gaussian. This task is achieved through a set of Python scripts and the following capabilities are currently available:

• Visualize potential energy surfaces (PES) of molecules.

• Calculate Raman intensities from Raman activities and plot bar graphs of IR and Raman intensities.
